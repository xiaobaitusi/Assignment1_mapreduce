Hi guys,
Since due is coming, maybe we can use GitHub to help us to keep us with the schedule. I am using this fancy guy for the very first time. But you can find out how to use it on the website: https://github.com/.

Basically, we can load the project to our local machine and push commits to the forked repository.
